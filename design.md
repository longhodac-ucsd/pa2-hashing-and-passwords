1. Real password crackers try many more variations than just uppercasing and lowercasing. Do a little research on password cracking and suggest at least 2 other ways to vary a password to crack it. Describe them both, and for each, write a sentence or two about what modifications you would make to your code to implement them.

- Adding numbers or symbols: Some sites require you to insert at least 1 number or 1 symbol for the password. People also often add numbers or symbols to their passwords. For example: password123!. To implement this into my code, I would loop through an array of common number or symbols to add each one to the beginning or end of the password string, and check each variation with check_pasword()

- leetspeak: Characters in password are replaced with similar looking symbols like "@" for "a" or "3" for "e". Like rewriting "password" to "p@ssw0rd". To implement this into my code, I would edit my crack_password function to convert characters into their leetspeak equivalents in a for loop. By trying multiple substitutions at the same time (for example, replacing both "a" and "o" in one password), this approach would cover more variations, though it would be more demanding on the CPU. The function would go through each possible leetspeak change, making it more thorough but also requiring more processing power.

2. How much working memory is needed to store all of the variables needed to execute the password cracker? Based on your response would you say that a password cracker is more memory-limited or is it more limited by how fast the process can run the code?

I think the amount of working memory needed to store all the varibles depends on the data structure used to store potential passwords and temporary values for computing each password's hash. If it generates each password variation on the fly, memory use stays low. But if it stores many possible passwords to compare against, memory requirements increase. So password cracking more limited by the processor speed since the main task is comparing each variation quickly.
